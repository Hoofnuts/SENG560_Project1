# SENG560_Project1
This project is to implement a basic math lirary
There are a couple of implementations of math functions in the library
The most useful one is more likely the classes in the StringUtils package
  -Static methods for performing arithmetic functions
  -Static methods for converting between data types
The AbstractUtils Package contains a set of classes, one for each type of data and its corresponding math functions
  -The MathAbstract class is the parent abstract class, implemented with generics
  -The remaining classes in that package are for math with each type of data
