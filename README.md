# SENG560_Project1
This project is to implement a basic math library
There are a couple of different implementations of math functions in the library
The most useful one is likely to be the classes in the StringUtils package, which contains:
  -Static methods for performing arithmetic functions
  -Static methods for converting between data types
The AbstractUtils Package contains a set of classes, one for each type of data and its corresponding math functions:
  -The MathAbstract class is the parent abstract class, implemented with generics
  -The remaining classes in that package are for math with each type of data
