# SENG560_Project1
This project is to implement a basic math library. There are a couple of different implementations of math functions in the library, but the most useful one is likely to be the classes in the StringUtils package. They contain static methods for performing arithmetic functions as well as static methods for converting between data types. All methods take in strings and return strings, so they provide common interfaces to calling applications. 

The AbstractUtils Package contains a set of classes, one for each type of data and its corresponding math functions. The MathAbstract class is the parent abstract class, implemented with generics and the remaining classes in that package are for math with each type of data.

# Reusability
This library can easily be used or extended in Java. The common format of using and returning strings for the StringUtils package would be useful especially in UI applications where things are displayed as strings.
