# SENG560_Project1
This project is to implement a basic math library. There are a couple of different implementations of math functions in the library, but the most useful one is likely to be the classes in the StringUtils package. It contains static methods for performing arithmetic functions as well as static methods for converting between data types. The AbstractUtils Package contains a set of classes, one for each type of data and its corresponding math functions. The MathAbstract class is the parent abstract class, implemented with generics and the remaining classes in that package are for math with each type of data.
